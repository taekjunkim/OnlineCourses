# **Asymptotic Notation**
Asymptotic Notation is used to describe the running time of an algorithm - how much time an algorithm takes with a given input, n.

## **Big-O Notation**
The Big-O notation describes the worst-case running time of a program. We compute the Big-O of an algorithm by counting how many iterations an algorithm will take in the worst-case scenario with an input of N. We typically consult the Big-O because we must always plan for the worst case. For example, O(log n) describes the Big-O of a binary search algorithm.

## **Algorithmic Common Runtimes**
The common algorithmic runtimes from fastest to slowest are: 
* constant: O(1)
* logarithmic O(log N)
* linear: O(N)
* polynomial: O(N^2)
* exponential: O(2^N)
* factorial: O(N!)
