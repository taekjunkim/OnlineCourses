# What is data-structure
* Store and organize data to enable operations over it

## kinds of data structures that we commonly encounter
* Arrays
* Hashtables
* Heaps
* Trees
* Graphs

## The "Data" in a Data-structure
* **Data**: can be any object. Each object has a key or unique way ot identifying it
> * Basic type such as int, str, ...
> * User-defined class, ...

## Data Structure Operations
* **Insert** a new data item into the data structure
* **Find** all items associated with a given key
* **Remove** a specific item from the data structure
* **Iterate** over all items in the daa-structure one by one
* *Special Application-Specific Operations*:
    * Find the object with least value for some specific field
    * Sort the objects in a specific manner
    * Update information associated with some data object
    * Reorganize the data in a specific manner

## Python Built-In Data-Structure #1: List
* Operations supported
    * Append (push)
    * Insert at arbitrary position
    * Remove/Delete from end
    * Remove/Delete from arbvitrary position
    * Access Nth element
    * Iterate over elements

## Python Built-In Data-Structure #2: Dictionaries
* Operations supported
    * Find the value associated with a key
    * Add/Remove/Replace a key, value binding
    * Iterate over all keys
