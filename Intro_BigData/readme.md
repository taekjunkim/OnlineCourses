## What launched the Big Data era?
Combination of a growing amount of data and on-demand (e.g., cloud) computing
* **on-demand computing**: computing anywhere and anytime


## What makes big data valuable?
Big data allows us to build better models, which produce higher precision results

Examples are ...
* **Recommendation Engines**: Personalized marketing data
* **Sentiment Analysis**
   * Natural language processing
* **Biomedical Application** 
   * Human genone sequencing 
   * Personalized treatment


## Characteristics of Big Data
The V's of Big Data
* **Volume**: scale of data
* **Velocity**: analysis of streaming data
   * different from **batch processing**
      * collect data --> clean data --> feed in chunks --> wait --> action
   * **real time processing**
      * instantly capture streaming data --> feed real time to machines --> process real time --> action
      * what's going on right now: data generated at a varied rates
* **Variety**: different forms of data
* **Veracity**: uncertainty of data = biases, noise, abnormality in data
   * Quality of data
   * Accuracy of data, Reliability of data source, Context within analysis
* **Valence**: connectedness


## Integrating Diverse Data
* Data Integration Process
   * Discovering, Accessing, Monitoring
   * Modeling, Transforming
* Data integration provides 
   * reduced data complexity, increased data availabilty, unify your data system
   * increase data collaboration
   * add value to your big data

## What is a Distributed File System?
* Long-term information storage
   * Access result of a process later
   * Store large amounts of information
   * Enable access of multiple process
* **Distributed File System (DFS)**
   * Data partitioning and Data replication
      * can provide: Data scalability, Fault tolerance, High concurrency


## Scalable Computing Over the Internet
* Long-term information storage
