* Basic cover letter
  - To write a basic cover letter, open with a greeting and address the letter to a specific person whenever possible. If you don’t know a name, address it to the title of the person you hope will see the letter, such as “Dear Hiring Manager”. Use correct business punctuation.
  - In the first paragraph, state the title of the job to which you’re applying, and why you feel you might be a good fit. It’s also sometimes useful to mention where you saw the job listed or who referred you, and it can be very effective if you can express why you are enthusiastic about the company.
    - I was excited when my colleague Janna Navarro told me your company had an opening for a Data Analyst 2. I have admired the products developed by Torotoni Software for many years, and I would be very interested in joining your team. I am a data analyst with 3 years of professional experience and skills that match your needs, and I think I would be a strong candidate.
  - Next, build a case for your strengths as a candidate. Cite a few examples from your experience that match the skills they mentioned in the job listing; draw parallels between the listing and your resume and portfolio. Quantify your experiences when possible. However, keep this brief and focused. Pick some best examples and keep some of your work to discuss further when you interview.
    - In my most recent role, I maintained and extended a mission-critical database and prepared a weekly report of changes and trends for stakeholders. I also worked with the coding and management teams to improve functionality of the database by 45%, advised on compliance issues, and supervised the work of 2 interns. I know SQL and Python, have intermediate proficiency in Hadoop and Apache Spark, and have used Tableau software for visualization.
  - Finally, close by restating your interest, say you hope to meet with them further, and then add a polite signoff.
    - Thank you for your consideration. I would love to bring my skills to Torotoni Software, and I’m eager to discuss the contributions I can make to your team.

* Elevator pitch
  - Even though employers are unlikely to ask you for an elevator pitch directly, having one ready will help you in many situations. It can help you draft a cover letter, speak easily to a potential hirer when you network at an event, answer general interview questions such as “tell us about yourself,” and so on.
  - “Hi, I’m Jonathan Bittmann. I’m a data scientist working toward a move into management. I’ve spent the last six years as a data analyst for a cloud development company, where I’ve developed my skills in programming and served as team leader. While leading several successful project teams, I became interested in data science management and have gone back to school to earn a business administration degree. While I’m working on that, I’m looking for a position in project management so I can put my learning to use. I’m very interested in the work your company does and I think I could bring a lot of expertise and leadership to your organization. Could we meet to discuss the open project manager roles you currently have?”
